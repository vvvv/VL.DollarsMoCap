# VL.DollarsMoCap

Adds support to access skeleton and face blend mesh data by [Dollars MONO](https://www.dollarsmocap.com/mono).

With Dollars MONO running using even just a simple webcam, vvvv connects to its network stream of data and returns full skeleton joint info (including fingers) and values for [52 blend meshes as defined by ARKit](https://arkit-face-blendshapes.com/).

For use with vvvv, the visual live-programming environment for .NET: http://vvvv.org
